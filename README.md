This Python program demonstrates a simple CAPTCHA generation and validation process. A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response test used to determine whether or not the user is human.

Explanation of the Code
CAPTCHA Validation Function:

The function checkCaptcha(captcha, user_captcha) compares the generated CAPTCHA with the user input. If they match, it returns True, indicating the CAPTCHA is validated; otherwise, it returns False.
CAPTCHA Generation Function:

The function generateCaptcha(n) generates a random string of length n composed of letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and digits. It selects characters from the string chrs and appends them to the CAPTCHA string until it reaches the desired length.
Main Program:

The main program generates a 9-character long CAPTCHA using generateCaptcha(9).
It prints the generated CAPTCHA and prompts the user to input the same.
It then checks if the user input matches the generated CAPTCHA using checkCaptcha(captcha, usr_captcha) and prints whether the CAPTCHA is matched or not.
